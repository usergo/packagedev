# Git branching strategies

* trunk versus git flow

* git flow = tight review for all of the code merged to the "main" branch by seasoned/lead dev(s)
    * common for open source
    * slows speed
    * enforces quality
    * long lived feature branches can pose merge conflicts

* trunk = a core "trunk" or main branch is used, seasoned devs mostly work off this main branch
    * common for seasoned teams
    * rapid
    * holistic code reviews
    * can pose quality problems
